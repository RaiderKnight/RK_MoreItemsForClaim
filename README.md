## More Items For Claim
This mod adds two more claim blocks to the game.
Extends the maximum claim time to 25 days.
You can also pay your taxes with dirt, hand torches and skulls.

I made this mod specifically to get rid of my useless items, I will surely add more items over time!
These can be useful for remote territories.
