<h3>More Items For Claim</h3>
<p>This mod adds two more claim blocks to the game.</p>
<p>Extends the maximum claim time to 25 days.</p>
<p>You can also pay your taxes with:</p>
<ul><li>Dirt</li>
  <li>Hand torches</li>
  <li>Impaled skulls</li>
  <li>Skulls</li>
  <li>Weights</li></ul>
<br>
<p>I made this mod specifically to get rid of my useless items, I will surely add more items over time!</p>
<p>These can be useful for remote territories.</p>
<br>
It will be displayed as not compatible because it hasn't been published on Steam Workshop yet, but it works. Will be released in a few days on Steam.
