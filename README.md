<h3>More Items For Claim</h3>
<p>This mod adds two more claim blocks to the game.</p>
<p>Extends the maximum claim time to 25 days.</p>
<p>You can also pay your taxes with dirt, hand torches and skulls.</p>
<br>
<p>I made this mod specifically to get rid of my useless items, I will surely add more items over time!</p>
<p>These can be useful for remote territories.</p>
